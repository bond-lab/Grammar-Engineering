<h2><a name="baseline">Run a baseline test suite</a></h2>

<p>Before making any changes to your grammar for this lab,
run a baseline test suite instance.  If you decide to add 
items to your test suite for the material covered here, consider
doing so before modifying your grammar so that your baseline can
include those examples.  (Alternatively, if you add examples
in the course of working on your grammar and want to make the
snapshot later, you can do so using the grammar you turned
in for Lab 5.)

<hr>
<h2><a name="q">Matrix yes-no questions</a></h2>

<P>The semantics for declarative and interrogative clauses will
be the same except for the value of the feature <tt>SF</tt> (sentential
force) on the event index of the main predicate.  

<P>The customization script may have provided the right kind
of semantics for matrix yes-no questions already. Try parsing
an example from your test suite.  If it parses, examine the MRS.
Is the value of <tt>SF</tt> on the INDEX of the clause <i>ques</i>?
(Or in the case of intonation questions only, do you get <i>prop-or-ques</i>?)

<p>If your yes-no question doesn't parse, or if it does but not
with the right semantics, contact me, and we will work out what
needs to be done.  

<hr>
<h2><a name="emb">Embedded clauses</a></h2>

<h2>Clause embedding verbs</h2>

<p>We will be using clausal complements as our example of embedded
clauses.  To do so, we need to create clause-embedding verbs.  First,
find examples of verbs that can embed propositions and verbs that can
embed questions.  If you also find verbs that are happy to embed
either, we can make use of them.  For inspiration, you can look <a
href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Main/EngPTBVerbs">here</a>
or <a
href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/twiki/bin/view.cgi/Main/EspDecVerbs">here</a>.

<ul> <li>Create another subtype of <tt>verb-lex</tt> (or
<tt>main-verb-lex</tt>) which inherits from
<tt>clausal-second-arg-trans-lex-item</tt> (the type for verbs like
<i>think</i>, <i>ask</i>, and <i>know</i>).

  <li>Constrain the
<tt>CAT</tt> value of the complement appropriately (the feature
specifications of S, CP or either depending on what's going on with
your embedded clauses).  The <tt>CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SF</tt> should also
be constrained to <i>prop-or-ques</i>.

  <li>Create two subtypes, one
which constrains the <tt>CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SF</tt> to <i>prop</i> and
one which constrains it to <i>ques</i>.

  <li>Create lexical entries
for verbs inheriting from one or the other subtypes (or the supertype)
as appropriate.  </ul>

<p>If your matrix and embedded clauses look the same, you should be
able to test this immediately.  If not, you'll have to wait until
you've implemented the syntax for your embedded clauses.

<h3>Complementizers</h3>

<p>Some languages mark embedded clauses (declaractive, interrogative
or both) with complementizers (e.g., <i>that</i> and <i>whether</i> in
English).  To implement this, you'll need to do the following.  (If
your language also marks matrix questions with a question particle,
you have some of the following in your grammar already.)

<ul>
  <li>Create a type <i>complementizer-lex-item</i> which inherits
from <i>raise-sem-lex-item</i> and <i>basic-one-arg</i>.  It should
identify the one thing on the <tt>ARG-ST</tt> with the sole item of
its <tt>COMPS</tt> list and otherwise have empty valence features.
It's <tt>HEAD</tt> value should be <i>comp</i>.

  <li>If you have both interrogative and declarative complementizers,
make subtypes for each, constraining the <tt>CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SF</tt>
on each of them to <i>question</i> and <i>proposition</i> respectively.

  <li>If you have just one kind of comlementizer, you can put the <tt>SF</tt>
constraint on <i>complementizer-lex-item</i> directly.

  <li>Create lexical entries for your complementizers.  These do not
need any <tt>KEYREL</tt> information.
</ul>

<p>Test your embedded clauses.  Do they parse as expected?  Can you
still generate?

<p>(Note: Many of you have semantically empty lex entries in your
grammar, which will tend to make the generator unhappy, unless
you add trigger rules.  I'll try to add info about creating trigger
rules by Monday or so.)

<h3>Other strategies</h3>

<p>Other possible syntactic differences between main and subordinate
clauses include:

<ol>
<li>Differences in word order (the general strategy here will be
to add more head-subj and head-comp variants, but to constrain some
of them to be <tt>[MC +]</tt> and/or <tt>[MC -]</tt>).
<li>Different verb forms (the general strategy here will be lexical
rules which produce the forms of the embedded verbs and give them
a distinctive <tt>HEAD.FORM</tt> value that the embedding verbs
and/or complementizers can select for).
</ol>

<p>Consult with me to work out an analysis for whatever your language
is doing in this case.

<h3>The feature MC</h3>

<p>If your matrix and embedded clauses have different syntactic properties
(e.g., presence v.\ absence of complementizers), you'll need to constrain
things so that the embedded clause syntax only appears in embedded clauses
and vice versa for matrix clause syntax.   There are three resources
for doing so:

<ul>
<li>The root condition
<li>The selecting context for the embedded clauses (i.e., the embedded
verb)
<li>The feature <tt>MC</tt> (inside <tt>CAT</tt>)
</ul>

<p>If the difference is strictly S v. CP, you don't need the feature
<tt>MC</tt>.  Otherwise, you probably will need all three: The root
condition will require <tt>[MC +]</tt>, the embedding verb will
require <tt>[MC -]</tt>, and the constructions/lexical rules/etc which
create the embedded and matrix clauses themselves should set
appropriate values for <tt>MC</tt>.

<p>Be sure your test suite contains negative examples illustrating 
matrix clause syntax in embedded clauses and vice versa.

<a name="mrs1"><h3>Check your MRSs</h3></a>

<p>Here are some examples to give you an idea of what
we're looking for.  (This is the "indexed MRS" view.)

<p><small>(NB 2/17/12: These are somewhat out of date, because the
LKB displays the GTOP not the LTOP for the whole MRS.
If you look at the feature structure rather than the 
extracted MRS, you should see that the LTOP matches the LBL
of the matrix verb's relation.)</small>

<p><i>I know that you sleep.</i>

<p>Note the qeq linking the ARG2 position
of _know_v_rel (h18) to the LBL of _sleep_v_rel (h14),
and the SF value of e15 (PROP).

<pre>
&lt;h1, e2:PRESENT:PROP-OR-QUES,
{ h3:_pronoun_n_rel(x4:IN-FOC:FIRST:SG),
h5:exist_q_rel(x4, h6, h7),
h1:_know_v_rel(e2, x4, h8),
h9:_pronoun_n_rel(x10:IN-FOC:SECOND),
h11:exist_q_rel(x10, h12, h13),
h14:_sleep_v_rel(e15:PRESENT:PROP, x10) }
{h6 qeq h3
h8 qeq h14
h12 qeq h9} &gt;
</pre>

<p><i>I ask whether you sleep.</i>

<p>Note the qeq linking the ARG2 position
of _ask_v_rel (h18) to the LBL of _sleep_v_rel (h14),
and the SF value of e15 (QUES).

<pre>
&lt;h1, e2:PRESENT:PROP-OR-QUES,
{ h3:_pronoun_n_rel(x4:IN-FOC:FIRST:SG),
h5:exist_q_rel(x4, h6, h7),
h1:_ask_v_rel(e2, x4, h8),
h9:_pronoun_n_rel(x10:IN-FOC:SECOND),
h11:exist_q_rel(x10, h12, h13),
h14:_sleep_v_rel(e15:PRESENT:QUES, x10) }
{h6 qeq h3
h8 qeq h14
h12 qeq h9} &gt;
</pre>

<a name="cop"><h2>Non-verbal predicates</h2></a>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>The goal of this lab is to extend the grammars to cover sentences
where the main (semantic) predicate is not a verb, i.e., NP, PP, and
AP predicates.  In some languages (including English) such predicates
require the "support" of a particular bleached verb (the copula, or
perhaps a verb of location).  In others, they can serve as predicates
on their own.  In still other languages, we find a mix:  The copula
(or other verb) is required for certain types of predicates or in certain
tenses but not others.  Or the copula (or other verb) is optional:
possible but not required.

<P>It's also possible that in some languages the copula is optional
in matrix clauses but required in embedded clauses.  I haven't found
an example like this yet, but I'd be curious to know about it if
you find one.

<hr>
<h3>Adpositions</h3>

<p>Some of your grammars have adpositions already, but few, if any,
have semantically contentful adpositions.  You'll need to define these
for this lab.  The matrix provides a type
basic-int-mod-adposition-lex, which should have most of the
information required.  Define a subtype with appropriate constraints
on the MOD and VAL values, and try it out to see what else you might
need to add.

<hr>
<h3>Copula (AP or PP predicates)</h3>

<P>We analyze copulas as semantically empty auxiliaries.  You
may already have a type very similar to this. The copula is likely
to have different requirements on its complement than other auxiliary
verbs, so you'll probably need to create subtypes, or for each.
The tdl for a copula should look something like this:

<pre>
copula-verb-lex := verb-lex-supertype & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-2 &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.VAL [ SUBJ < #subj >,
                             COMPS < #comps >,
                             SPR < >,
                             SPEC < > ],
                   CONT.HOOK.XARG #xarg ],
    ARG-ST < #subj &
             [ LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg,
                       CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                   COMPS < > ],
                             HEAD noun ] ] ],
             #comps &
             [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL [ COMPS < > ],
                           HEAD +jp ] ] > ].
</pre>

<p>You'll also need to create <tt>verb-lex-supertype</tt> which 
inherits from some of the types that your <tt>verb-lex</tt> type
does, but not all of them.  In particular, you want to get
the types that give it access to whatever verbal morphology
is relevant, as well as constraining it to be [HEAD verb].

<p>The constraint <tt>[HEAD +jp]</tt> on the complement specifies that
the complement should be (headed by) an adjective or an adposition.
Depending on where copulas are required in your language, you might
want to change this.  If you need to give adjectives or adpositions
non-empty SUBJ lists (e.g., because they can be stand-alone predicates
in some cases; see below), then you'll also want to constrain the
COMPS's SUBJ to be < [ ] > (aka <tt>cons</tt>) to make sure that the subject
isn't realized twice.

<p>Note that the copula verb uses the XARG to do the linking (the
relevant constraint is declared on the supertype
trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item in matrix.tdl).  This means that the
adjectives and adpositions will need to link their ARG1 to their XARG.
This may already be the case, but you should double check.
<hr>

<h3>Copula (NP predicates)</h3>

<P>We will follow the ERG in positing a different copula
for use with NP predicates.  This is because we don't want
to give every noun a semantic argument position for a potential
subject.  The copula verb for NP predicates will instead introduce
an elementary predication linking its subject and complement.

<P>This means that in many languages, this copula might  just
be an ordinary transitive verb.  It's not in English, because it
also has auxiliary properties.  If the NP-predicate-supporting-copula
in your language differs in its behavior from (other) transitive
verbs, post to GoPost.

<p>The PRED value for this verb should be "_be_v_id_rel".

<hr>
<h3>Locative verbs</h3>

In some languages, PP predicates appear with a locative verb that
is not quite semantically bleached, but means something like "be-located".
In this case, it seems at least arguably incorrect to have the
verb not introduce any predicate of its own.  Instead, it will
be an example of trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-1:

<pre>
locative-verb-lex := verb-lex & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-1 &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.VAL [ SUBJ < #subj >,
                             COMPS < #comps >,
                             SPR < >,
                             SPEC < > ],
                   CONT.HOOK.XARG #xarg ],
    ARG-ST < #subj &
             [ LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg,
                       CAT [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                   COMPS < > ],
                             HEAD noun ] ] ],
             #comps &
             [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL [ COMPS < > ],
                           HEAD adp ] ] > ].
</pre>


<P>Note that there are many share constraints between this
and copula-verb-lex.  If you have both, please make a supertype
for the shared constraints.

<P>The lexical entry for the locative verb can introduce
"_be+located_v_rel" as its LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED.
<hr>

<h2>APs and PPs as stand-alone predicates</h2>

<p>If your language allows APs and PPs as stand-alone predicates,
the basic strategy is to modify the selecting contexts for
sentences (initial symbol, clause embedding verbs) to generalize
the requirements on HEAD.  This needs to be done slightly
differently depending on how tense/aspect are marked in these
clauses.

<p>Note that some languages don't have adjectives at all,
just a class of stative intransitive verbs.  For present
purposes, the definitive test is what happens when these
elements modify nouns.  If they appear to enter the same
construction as relative clauses headed by transitive verbs
(and non-stative intransitives), then they're just verbs.
However, for the purposes of the MT exercise, it will be helpful
to have their PRED values end in _a_rel, rather than _v_rel.


<h3>Non-empty SUBJ values</h3>

<p>[Updated 2/6/12]

<p>The first step is to get from the attributive entries
for As or Ps (or both) to predicative uses.  It may be possible
to use one and the same lexical entry in both uses.  To
enable predicative uses, your As or Ps (or both) need to have
non-empty SUBJ lists.  The sole element of the SUBJ list should
be an NP or PP as appropriate (with appropriate constraints
on its CASE value), and share its INDEX with the XARG and
ARG1 of the A/P.  (This index sharing is the same as with
the MOD value.)

<p>Finally, if some but not all As or Ps can serve as predicates,
you can handle this by declaring a new feature, PRD, on the type
head.  Make the attributive-only As/Ps [PRD -], and any
predicative-only ones [PRD +]. Then edit the root condition
to require [PRD +]. This can also be useful if you have different
inflection for predicative v.\ attributive uses of adjectives.

<pre>
head :+ [ PRD bool ].
</pre>


<h3>Unrestricted tense/aspect</h3>

<p>If an AP or PP stand-alone predicate has underspecified tense and aspect
(i.e., can be used in any tense/aspect context) or if it actually
takes tense/aspect markers directly, then you can allow for
AP or PP predicates by redefining the selecting contexts.  In particular:

<ul>
  <li>Change the HEAD value on the root condition to allow adjectives
  and adpositions (+vj, +vp, or +vjp).
  <li>Change the HEAD value on the clausal complement position of clause-embedding verbs (as above).
  </ul>

<p>Note that even if it is possible to use a copula for, e.g., past
  tense AP/PP predicate sentences, you might still have unrestricted
  tense/aspect on the copulaless counterparts of these sentences.  The
  key question is whether the copulaless sentences are necessarily
  interpreted as having a particular tense/aspect value.  If so, see
  the next section.
  
<h3>Restricted to (e.g.) present tense sentences</h3>

If APs or PPs without a copula are interpreted as having some specific
  tense/aspect value (e.g., present tense) then these sentences need
  to have their TENSE value constrained.  I see several ways of doing
  this. Though none jumps out yet as ideal (especially at a
  cross-linguistic level), the third one is probably the best of the
  bunch. If you need one or more elaborated, please post to GoPost:

  <ol>
    <li>The selecting contexts are bifurcated allowing [HEAD verb] constituents (with any tense/aspect value) and [HEAD adp] or [HEAD adj] or [HEAD +jp] constituents with only a particular tense/aspect value. This would be reasonably easy for the root condition (you can have more than one, just define them in roots.tdl and then reference them in the definition of *start-symbol* in lkb/globals.lsp).  It's a bit clunkier in the case of clause-embedding verbs, which would need two entries each.
    <li>There is a non-branching rule that turns a PP/AP headed constituent into something that looks like an S ([HEAD verb, SUBJ < >, COMPS < >]), and along the way fills in the tense information.
    <li>You write lexical rules to create predicative and attributive
    forms of As/Ps from uninflected base forms (even if there is no
    overt morphology involved).  One rule gives PRD + forms which have
    the specific TENSE value required.  The other makes PRD -
    forms. In this case, if the copula can combine with APs/PPs, it
    would actually take the PRD - ones, so it can fill in different
    tense information.
 </ol>
  

<hr>
  
<h2>NPs as stand-alone predicates</h2>

<p>Finally, we come to the case of NPs used as predicates without any
    supporting verb.  As with NPs used as the complement of a copula,
    we need to do something to get an extra predication in.  Here, I
    think the best solution is a non-branching non-headed phrase
    structure rule which takes an NP daughter and produces a VP
    mother.  It should introduce the "_be_v_id_rel" relation through
    the C-CONT.RELS, linking the C-CONT.INDEX to the ARG0 of this
    relation.  If NPs as stand-alone predicates necessarily get
    present tense interpretation, this rule can also fill in that
    information.

    <p>If you also need a non-branching rule for tense-restricted PP or AP predicates, you might consider doing those the same way (VP over PP/AP), and sharing many constraints between the two rules.  Note, however, that the PP/AP rule would have an empty C-CONT.RELS list.
    
<hr>
<a name="mrs"><h3>Check your MRSs</h3></a>

<p>Here are some sample MRSs to give you a sense of what we're looking
    for.  Note that yours might differ in detail, because of e.g., different tense values or the use of a locative verb.


    <p><i>The child is happy.</i>

h13:_winner_n_rel(x9)}
{h7 qeq h3
h12 qeq h13} &gt;
</pre>

    <h2>Test your grammar</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use your test suite to check the syntactic coverage of your grammar.
<li>Examine the semantic representations you assign to each of
the clause types.
<li>Check for overgeneration (syntactic forms associated with 
one clause type showing up in other clause types, multiple parses
for single sentences with spurious clause type assignments or
lack of clausal semantics).
<li>Make sure your grammar still generates.
</ul>
