<h1>Computational Grammars: MT</h1>

<h3>Running the translation system</h3>

<p>The first step is to get the tranlsation system running
from your language to English (xxx2eng).  Here are step-by-step
instructions:

<ol>
<li>Download the <a href="eng.tgz">English</a> grammar.  Unpack it
them with <tt>tar xzf eng.tgz</tt>.  Or use the ERG (more fun).
<li>Set up your grammar:
<ul>
  <li>Edit the file <tt>lkb/globals.lsp</tt> to add the following line,
    with "iso" replaced by the three-letter iso code for your language:
<pre>
(setf *translate-grid* '(:iso :eng :frr))
</pre>

  <li>Edit the file <tt>lkb/globals.lsp</tt> in the English and Frisian
    grammars so that the line for *translate-grid* now looks like
    the appropriate one of the lines below (again replacing "iso" with the
    code for your language).
    
<pre>
(setf *translate-grid* '(:eng :frr :iso))
(setf *translate-grid* '(:frr :eng :iso))
</pre>

  <li>Edit the file <tt>lkb/mrsglobals.lsp</tt> in your grammar to add the following line:
<pre>
(setf *show-lnk-p* nil)
</pre>
</ol>
<li>Start two separate emacsen.  Put one on the left of your
screen (this will be the "source" emacs).  Put one on the right
of your screen ("target" emacs).
<li>Start the LKB in each.  Make sure the "source" LKB Top menu
is on the left of the screen and the "target" one is on the right.
<li>Load the your grammar into the "source" LKB.
<li>Load the English grammar into the "target" LKB.
<li>In the "target" LKB, select Options | Expand menu.
<li>In the "target" LKB, select Generate | Start server.
<li>In the "source" emacs/lkb parse the equivalent of the English
sentence <i>Dogs sleep.</i>
<li>From the pop-up menu on the tree that comes up, select "Rephrase."
You should see a transfer output window and then the English grammar should output "Dogs sleep." in a realizations window.
<li>Observe what happens: Do you get generation outputs?  Some
error in the emacs buffer in the "target" emacs?
<li>If you get an error, you'll need to compare the MRSs to to see
what the difference is.  I expect that for <i>Dogs sleep</i> you won't
need any transfer rules (depending on what you called your
predicates), and thus any errors should be addressed through
harmonization (aka cleaning up your MRS) and/or work on your semi.vpm
file.
</ol>

<h3>Comparing MRSs</h3>

<p>To compare the MRSs, you can look at the MRS from the English
grammar directly, but this can be a bit misleading, since you really
want to look at the input to the generator (i.e., the transfer
output).  To do this, you can select "Generate | Display Input MRS" or
"Generate | Display Internal MRS" from the "target" LKB Top menu.

<ol>
<li>Generate | Display Internal MRS
<li>Parse the expected output
<li>Choose Indexed MRS from the pop-up menu
</ol>

<p>There are a number of things that could be wrong:

<ol>
<li>Missing RELS or HCONS (broken diff-list append).
<li>Misspelled PRED values (look carefully at the underscores).
<li>Misspelled/differently spelled feature values (e.g. <i>sing</i>
instead of <i>sg</i>). 
<li>Misspelled/differently spelled feature <b>names</b> (e.g., PERS
instead of PER).
  <li>Incompatible variable properties (features and values).
</ol>

<h2><a name="vpm">Variable property mapping</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that you get many variants on generation if
you start with a form that is underspecified for e.g., aspect or
evidentiality.  We can get a handle on this by using variable property
mapping to supply default values in the unmarked case (either in
monolingual generation or in the MT scenario).  The basic strategy is
to take any underspecified values in variable properties and translate
them, via vpm, to something that conflicts with any more specific
values your grammar can produce.

<p>The file semi.vpm provides a mapping between grammar-external
features of indices (referential indices and events) and their values,
and grammar-internal ones.  For background on VPM, see the
<a href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/RmrsVpm">DELPH-IN wiki</a>.
As soon as you start using a VPM file, then only variable properties
(features on indices) that are handled in the file are actually
preserved.

<ol>
<li>You should already have a semi.vpm file provided by
the customization system.  Open it up and see which variable
properties are there, and then look in your grammar to
see what is missing. In general, we'd expect to see all
of the features of the types <tt>event</tt> and <tt>ref-ind</tt>
represented in a mature semi.vpm file.
<li>You need to tell the lkb to load the semi.vpm file by uncommenting
the following line in <tt>lkb/script</tt>:

<pre>
(mt:read-vpm (lkb-pathname (parent-directory) "semi.vpm") :semi)
</pre>

<li>This line needs to be moved higher in the script file,
specifically, it needs to be <b>before</b> the code block that loads
the trigger rules.

<li>You'll also need to add this lines to <tt>lkb/mrsglobals.lsp</tt>:

<pre>
(setf *variable-type-mapping* :semi)
</pre>

  <li>If your grammar uses a PERNUM feature, you'll need to map
  separate PER and NUM features from the external (right-hand side) of
  the VPM to a single PRENUM feature on the internal (left-hand side).
  See the example under "Properties: An Example" on the <a
  href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/RmrsVpm">DELPH-IN wiki</a> page.
      <li>If your grammar encodes aspectual distinctions, you'll need
  to add an ASPECT section, modeled on tense. This should allow you
  to create and use specific a default value of ASPECT.
<li>If you have any other features you have added on indices, you
will need to provide VPM entries for them as well.
  <li>If your language has aspect marked in some sentences but other forms that are just underspecified for aspect, you'll want to have the default aspect be "no-aspect".  Define this as a subtype of aspect in your grammar, but don't have anything other than the semi.vpm mention it otherwise.
<li>You can do a similar trick for other kinds of generation ambiguity
relating to variable properties.
</ol>

<p>Test your semi.vpm file by parsing and then generating.  You
should see fewer strings coming out.

<h2><a name="mt">First MT</h2>

  
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>


<p>This week, we'll be using the LOGON MT set up, which doesn't
respect ICONS.  I hope to also try the ACE set up, which does.
(But you'll still need the LOGON/LKB version in order to debug
transfer, I believe.)

<h3>Running the translation system</h3>

<p>The first step is to get the translation system running
for English to Frisian (eng2frr).  Here are step-by-step
instructions:

<h3>Update semi.vpm, if necessary</h3>

<p>The file semi.vpm provides a mapping between grammar-external
features of indices (referential indices and events) and their values,
and grammar-internal ones.  For background on VPM, see the
<a href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/RmrsVpm">DELPH-IN wiki</a>.

<ol>
  <li>If your grammar uses a PERNUM feature, you'll need to map
  separate PER and NUM features from the external (right-hand side) of
  the VPM to a single PRENUM feature on the internal (left-hand side).
  See the example under "Properties: An Example" on the <a
  href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/RmrsVpm">DELPH-IN wiki</a> page.  (There is also a an example in the semi.vpm file in the eng grammar.)
  <li>If your grammar encodes aspectual distinctions, you'll need
  to add an ASPECT section, modeled on tense. This should allow you
  to specific a default value of ASPECT as well.  <!--- Note that the English
  and Frisian grammars don't encode tense or aspect, so this is strictly
  for the MT demo.  --->
  <li>If your language has aspect marked in some sentences but other forms that are just underspecified for aspect, you'll want to have the default aspect be "no-aspect".  Define this as a subtype of aspect in your grammar, but don't have anything other than the semi.vpm mention it otherwise.  In the semi.vpm file, at hte bottom of your section on aspect, add:

<pre>
* >> no-aspect
no-aspect << [e]
</pre>
</ol>
  
<h3>Create a transfer grammar</h3>

<p>Once you have <i>Dogs sleep</i> translating, it's time to try
a broader range of the MMT sentences.

<p>Note that you will be modifying the English and Italian grammars
for this part of the lab.  You will need to add 
<tt>mt-mrs.tdl</tt>, <tt>mtr.tdl</tt> and <tt>acm.tdl</tt>.  Of
those, <tt>acm.tdl</tt> should be the most interesting. You'll
want to edit the file <tt>acm.mtr</tt> to create instances of the
transfer rules that you need for your grammar.  It will be simplest to
edit this file in one grammar (say the English one) and create a
symbolic link to it in the other grammar, so that you have one
transfer grammar for your language.

<ol>
<li>Try translating all of the MMT sentences from English to your
language and Italian to your language.
<li>For each one that doesn't go through, compare the input MRS
to the MRS your expected output is giving.
<li>Do any harmonization that is warranted.
<li>For the remaining differences, look to see if one of the existing
transfer rule types in <tt>acm.tdl</tt> will do the trick.  If so,
create an instance of that transfer rule type in <tt>acm.mtr</tt>, e.g.,:

<pre>
pro-drop := pronoun-delete-mtr.
</pre>

<li>If you need a different transfer rule, ask Petter or I about what
you need, and we'll work out how to formulate it.
<li>Reload the "source" grammar and try translating again.
<li>Rinse and repeat.
</ol>
</ul>

<h3>Running the translation system</h3>

<p>If you would like to try translating with ACE instead
(included in Ubuntu+LKB 17, 64-bit version), you can try out
<a href="ace-MT.txt">these instructions</a>, compiled by
Sanghoun Song.

<h3>Attempt to translate into your language</h3>

<h3>Comparing MRSs</h3>

<p>To compare the MRSs, you can look at the MRS from the English
grammar directly, but this can be a bit misleading, since you really
want to look at the input to the generator (i.e., the transfer
output).  To do this, you can select "Generate | Display Input MRS" or
"Generate | Display Internal MRS" from the "target" LKB Top menu.

<ol>
<li>Generate | Display Internal MRS
<li>Parse the expected output
<li>Choose Indexed MRS from the pop-up menu
</ol>

<p>There are a number of things that could be wrong:

<ol>
<li>Missing RELS or HCONS (broken diff-list append).
<li>Misspelled PRED values (look carefully at the underscores).
<li>Misspelled/differently spelled feature values (e.g. <i>sing</i>
instead of <i>sg</i>). 
<li>Misspelled/differently spelled feature <b>names</b> (e.g., PERS
instead of PER).
  <li>Incompatible variable properties (features and values).
</ol>

<h3>Update semi.vpm, if necessary</h3>

<p>The file semi.vpm provides a mapping between grammar-external
features of indices (referential indices and events) and their values,
and grammar-internal ones.  For background on VPM, see the
<a href="http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/RmrsVpm">DELPH-IN wiki</a>.
