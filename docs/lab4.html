<title>Computational Grammars: Lab 4</title>

<h1>Lab 4</h1>


<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The goal of this lab is once again to continue development of your
test suite on the one hand, and to refine your starter grammar on the
other.  This time, the test suite will include phenomena not covered
by the customization system (but on the agenda for the rest of the
quarter). The grammar work will include adding some new phenomena as
well as whatever clean-up is required to get to a good starting point.

<h2>Test Suite</h2>

<p>The first task is to create positive and negative example sentences
illustrating the following phenomena, to the extent that they
are relevant for your language:

<ul>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#yesno">matrix yes-no questions</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#coord">coordination</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#adj">attributive adjectives</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#adv">adverbs</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#emb">embedded clauses</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#copula">non-verbal predicates</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#info">information structure</a> 
</ul>

<p>Before you start, read the <a
href="testsuites.html#preliminaries">general instructions for
testsuites</a> and the <a href="testsuites.html#formatting">formatting
instructions.</a>

<h2>Starter grammar</h2>

<p>This week we'll do another round of grammar improvement
through the <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/customize/matrix.cgi">questionnaire</a>.    This time, you'll need to address these
sections:

<ul>
  <li>Matrix Yes-No Questions
  <li>Information Structure
  <li>Coordination
  <li>Lexicon (as appropriate)
  </ul>

<p>An additional goal for the starter grammars for this week is to get
to the best possible starting point.  I will try to get feedback
to you from Lab 3 quickly, and my feedback will contain suggestions
of what to clean up.  If we've been discussing any tdl-editing
for your grammar for phenomena already covered, this would be a good
time to do it.

<p>In addition, you should do the following:

</p><ul>
  <li>Review your grammar's performance over the test suite (using
  [incr tsdb()]) to determine whether there are any examples that you think should parse which currently don't.
  <li>Use interactive unification to determine the source of the parse failure, and think about  ideas about how to fix it.
  <li>Likewise, if you are overgenerating, think about how to fix it.
  In some cases, the advice might well be "we'll fix this later".
  <li>For the examples that do parse, examine the semantic
  representations (Simple MRS) to check whether the dependencies look
  correct.  That is, are the nouns showing up as the arguments of the
  verbs, and in the way you would expect?  Do you see correct values
  for tense, aspect, person, number and (where relevant) gender on the
  event and individual variables?
  <li>If you have any incorrect semantic representations, think about how to fix them.
</ul>

<h2>Make sure you can parse individual sentences</h2>

<p>Once you have created  your starter grammar (or each time you
create one, as you should iterate through grammar creation and
testing a few times as you refine your choices), try it out on a
couple of sentences interactively to see if it works:

<ol>
  <Li>Load the grammar into the LKB.
  <li>Using the parse dialog box (or <tt>C-c p</tt> in emacs  to get the parse
  command inserted at your prompt), enter a sentence to parse.
  <li>Examine the results.  If it does parse, check out the semantics (pop-up menu on the little trees).  If it doesn't look at the parse chart to see why not.
  <li>Problems with lexical rules and lexical entries often become apparent here, too: If the LKB can't find an analysis for one of your words, it will say so, and (obviously) fail to parse the sentence.
</ol>

<p>Note that the questionnaire has a section for test sentences.  If
you use this, then the parse dialog will be pre-filled with your test sentences.

<h2>[incr tsdb()] profile</h2>

<p>The final step for this lab is to use the [incr tsdb()] grammar
profiling system to test the performance of your starter grammar over
your test suite, and then examine the results.  (You may find in doing
so that you want to refine certain aspects of your starter grammar.
You can do this by uploading the file "choices" which comes with your
grammar into the customization system and then tweaking from there.)

<P>We expect to see an overall drop in coverage this week (since
you'll be adding sentences that we don't expect to parse yet), but
at the same time, some improvement over the subset of your test suite
that represents the last two weeks.

<h3>Create a test suite skeleton</h3>

<ul>
<li>From last week, you sould already have a <tt>tsdb</tt> directory
with subdirectories <tt>skeletons</tt> and <tt>home</tt>.  
<li>The <tt>skeletons</tt> subdirectory should have files <tt>Relations</tt>
and <tt>Index.lisp</tt>.
<li>Use <a href="make_item"><tt>make_item</tt></a> to create
a new <tt>item</tt> file from your current testsuite.
<li>You can replace <tt>skeletons/lab2/item</tt> (or <tt>skeletons/lab3/item</tt>) with this new file,
or create a new subdirectory in <tt>skeletons</tt> called <tt>lab4</tt>.
In that case, you'll need to copy <tt>skeletons/Relations</tt> to
<tt>skeletons/lab4/relations</tt>, put your new <tt>item</tt> in
<tt>skeletons/lab4/</tt>, and edit <tt>Index.lisp</tt> to add a line
for the <tt>lab4</tt> skeleton.
</ul>

<h3>Create and run an initial test suite instance</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start the lkb
<li>Load your starter grammar.  (The script file is in matrix/lkb/script.)
<li>Start [incr tsdb()] (within emacs, that's M-x itsdb)
<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select Options | Database Root
and input the path to <tt>tsdb/home</tt>.
<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select Options | Skeleton Root
and input the path to <tt>tsdb/skeletons</tt>.
<li>Optional: For future use, you can set these variables
ahead of time in a file called <tt>.tsdbrc</tt> in your home directory.
It should contain these lines, with path names edited appropriately:

<pre>
(in-package :tsdb)
(setf *tsdb-home* "path-to-tsdb/home")
(setf *tsdb-skeleton-directory* "path-to-tsdb/skeletons")
</pre>

<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select File | Create.  You should
see your test suite in the menu there.  Select it, and get a test suite
instance. 
<li>Make sure your grammr is loaded into the LKB.
<li>Once you have a test suite instance, select it (by clicking on it),
then do Process | All Items.
<li>Explore the results, with functions such as Browse | Results and Analyze | Competence.
<li>Be sure to save (i.e., not overwrite or delete) this test suite
instance, as you'll be asked to turn it in.
</ol>

<h2>Write up</h2>


<p>Your write up should include the following:

<ol>
  <li>Documentation of the new or revised choices you made in the customization
  system, illustrated with examples from your test suite.  (Diff your lab3 and lab4 choices files to make sure you've caught all the changes.) Here's <a href="write-up-sample.html">an example</a> of what this should look like.
  <li>Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated
  in your test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or
  the customization system. This will be most of the additions to your
  test suite this week.  Here, too, please include IGT from your testsuite,
  and give explanations along the lines of the example above (though without
  the information about the customization system).
  <li>Documentation of the coverage of your grammar over the testsuite.
  If there are examples that thare parsed incorrectly (unanalyzed
  grammatical examples, analyzed ungrammatical examples, or grammatical
  examples assigned surprising parses), reflect on why that might be.
  <li>Documentation of any changes you made to your grammar to improve
  its performance (coverage and accuracy).  Include the exmaples that
  motivated the change and explain what changes you made to the
  choices file or tdl.
</ol>

<h2><a name="submit">Submit your assignment</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure your write up and the text-file version of your test suite are
  included in your grammar directory.
  <li>Likewise, make sure to include your most current tsdb profile in the grammar directory (ideally inside tsdb/home/).
  <li>Create a tarball:

  <pre>
      tar czf yourname.tgz yourgrammar
    </pre>

  <li>Email the tarball to <a href="mailto:bond@ieee.org?subject=[HG7021] lab3">bond@ieee.org</a>.
