<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>These instructions might get edited a bit over the next
couple of days.  I'll try to flag changes.

<p>As usual, check the <a href="#writeup">write up instructions</a> first.

<a name="adjadv"><h2>Modification</h2></a>

<h3>Head-modifier rules</h3>

<p>The Matrix distinguishes scopal from intersective modification.
We're going to pretend that everything is intersective and
just not worry about the scopal guys for now (aside from negative
adverbs, if you got one from the customization system).

<ul>
<li>Create an instance of <i>head-adj-int-phrase</i>, an
instance of <i>adj-head-int-phrase</i>, or both, depending on
whether you need only prehead modifiers, only posthead modifiers,
or both.  (You may already have some of these, depending on
what you said about negation in the customization system.)  To
  do this, add the following to <tt>rules.tdl</tt>:

  <pre>
head-adj-int := head-adj-int-phrase.
adj-head-int := adj-head-int-phrase.
</pre>
  
<li>Try parsing a sentence without a modifier, and examine
the parse chart.  Did the head-adj phrase fire?  If so, 
Constrain your non-adj/adv subtypes of head.  You can do
  this by adding the following to your <tt>my_language.tdl</tt>.

  <pre>
+nvcdmo :+ [ MOD < > ].
</pre>

  <p>That adds the constraint <tt>[MOD < > ]</tt> to the
  type <i>+nvcdmo</i>, which is the supertype of all the head
  types other than <i>adj</i> and <i>adv</i>. (Notes: You might already have this constraint or a functionally equivalent one if your customized grammar
includes adverbial negation.  Constraining <i>+nvcdmo</i> isn't necessarily
the best way to do this, as you might want to allow nouny or verby things to be modifiers.  The alternative is to constrain the relevant lexeme types to have empty MOD values.)

<li>Try parsing the misbehaving sentence again.
</ul>

<h3>Adjectives</h3>

<ul>
<li>Create a type <i>adjective-lex</i> which inherits from
<i>basic-adjective-lex</i>. The following type works for English
assuming that:

<ol>
<li>We're not worried about predicative adjectives or adjectives
taking complements for now.
<li>English has both pre-head and post-head modifiers, (head-adj and adj-head), but simple adjectives
are (almost) always prehead (hence the value of POSTHEAD).
<li>We're only dealing with intersective adjectives (as stipulated).
</ol>

<pre>
adjective-lex := basic-adjective-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
	      norm-ltop-lex-item &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD noun,
                                                    VAL.SPR cons ]]>,
			   VAL [ SPR < >,
				 SUBJ < >,
				 COMPS < >,
				 SPEC < > ],
			   POSTHEAD - ]]]].
</pre>

<li>If adjectives display agreement in your language, you'll
be adding that information to the MOD value in agreement below.
For now, leave it underspecified (this will cause your grammar
to overgenerate).
<li>Create one or more adjective instances.
<li>Parse sentences with your adjectives, and examine the MRSs.
Are the adjective relations being predicated of the right indices?
</ul>

<h3>Adverbs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Create one or more types for adverbs.  The following type
      definition inherits from appropriately-defined Matrix supertypes,
      and constrains the modified constituent to be verbal.

<pre>
adverb-lex := basic-adverb-lex & intersective-mod-lex &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD.MOD < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD verb ]>,
			   VAL [ SPR < >,
				 SUBJ < >,
				 COMPS < >,
				 SPEC < > ]]]]].
</pre>

  <li>Try parsing a sentence with an adverb and then generating
      to see where else the adverb can show up.  If you language allows
      multiple attachment sites for the adverb, admire the results.
      If it doesn't, or doesn't allow *that* many, constrain them further.
  <li>In order to constrain the possible attachment sites
      for adverbs, you may need to constrain the value of POSTHEAD,
      or the value of SPR inside MOD or the value of LIGHT inside MOD. (<tt>[LIGHT +]</tt> picks out lexical Vs, including both transitive and intransitive ones.)
<li>Parse sentences with your adverbs, and examing the MRSs.
Are the adverb relations being predicated of the right indices?
</ul>


<a name="adjagr"><h3>Adjective Agreement</h3></a>

<p>To model adjective agreement, you'll probably want
to write lexical rules that inflect the adjectives and
constrain the features inside the MOD value so that each
inflected adjective can only modify the right kind of nouns.


<p>Below is some general information on writing lexical rules.
Please also refer to the lexical rules emitted by the
customization system.  Adjective agreement lexical rules
should be of the "add only" type.  Note that if you have an
apparently uninflected form, you'll need to make sure it
goes through a constant lexical rule (no spelling change)
which fills in the relevant feature values.

<a name="lexrules"><h3>Lexical rules</h3></a>

<ul> 
<li>Pick a supertype for your rule:

<ul>
<li>Determine whether your lexical rule needs to change SYNSEM
information, or just add to it.  (Examples: If the input has a
non-empty SPR list and the output has an empty SPR list, that's
changing information.  If the input has no value
specified for CASE and the output is [CASE nom], that's just adding
information.)

<li>Determine whether your lexical rule creates fully inflected
forms, or whether there's more inflection you'd like to stack
on top of it.  

<li>Rules creating fully inflected forms and only adding
information to SYNSEM can inherit from <i>infl-ltow-rule</i>
  <font color="red">and <i>add-only-no-ccont-rule</i><small>[Updated 2/3/10]</small></font>.
  

<li>Rules creating not-yet fully inflected forms and only adding
    information should inherit
from <i>infl-add-only-no-ccont-ltol-rule</i>.

<li>If your rule needs to change the SYNSEM value, determine
    which part of SYNSEM is changing (e.g., VAL only, HEAD only,
    CAT only) and choose an appropriate type out of the types
    called <i>infl-***-change-only-ltol-rule</i>.  Unless you're
	adding any relations, your rule should also inherit from
	<i>no-ccont-lex-rule</i>.  <b>I expect most lexical
rules created for this lab to be of the add-only variety, rather
than changing information.</b>
</ul>

<li>Define a rule type in <tt>my_language.tdl</tt> which contains
all of the information about your rule except the spelling changes.
The value of DTR should be specific enough to constrain the
rule to only applying to the right type of inputs.  The value of
SYNSEM should include the primary information contributed by the
rule (e.g., the constraints on MOD reflected in the agreement morphology).
If you aren't using one of the "add only" types, then you need to
be sure that the rest of the SYNSEM value is sufficiently constrained.
Here's an example from English (where
the value of SYNSEM ends up being very specific since all the
information from the daughter is also in the mother):

<pre>
3sg_verb-lex-rule := infl-ltow-rule &
  [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.SUBJ < [ LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG [ PER third,
							      NUM sg ]] >,
    DTR verb-lex ].
</pre>

<li>If you have multiple rules applying to the same form, constrain
the innermost (rightmost prefix or leftmost suffix) to take (some
subtype of) <i>lex-item</i> as its DTR.  The next one to apply to
should take the first rule as its DTR, etc. If multiple rules can
appear in one slot, define a supertype for them which can be the DTR
of the next rule type out.

<li>Define an instance of the rule type in <tt>irules.tdl</tt>.  This
instance should give the spelling change subrules on a line beginning
with <tt>%prefix</tt> or <tt>%suffix</tt>.  Assuming you're working
from regularized morphophonology, these should be simple concatenation,
of the form (* pref) or (* suff).

<li>A slightly more complicated example from English (without
regularized morphophonology) follows.  After <tt>%suffix</tt> there is 
a list of pairs in which the first member matches the input form
and the second member describes the output form.  * matches the empty
string.  ! signals a letter-set.  More specific subrules to the
right.

<pre>
3sg_verb :=
%suffix (!s !ss) (!ss !ssses) (ss sses)
3sg_verb-lex-rule.
</pre>

And here's the letter set that's used:

<pre>
%(letter-set (!s abcedfghijklmnopqrtuvwxyz))
</pre>

<li>Make sure that your lexical entries give the stem
instead of the inflected word (i.e., so that your lexical rule
can do the work). Be sure that the lexical type says
<tt>[INFLECTED -]</tt> if the rule is obligatory.  (And note
that lexical rules for agreement usually are.)


<li>Test your grammar.  Does the lexical rule apply to the
words it should apply to?  Does it apply to words it shouldn't apply to?
</ul>

<h2><a name="cogst">Demonstratives and definiteness</a></h2>

<h3>The basics</h3>

<p>We are modeling the cognitive status attributed to discourse
referents by particular referring expressions through a pair of
features <tt>COG-ST</tt> and <tt>SPECI</tt> on <i>ref-ind</i> (the
value of <tt>INDEX</tt> for nouns).  Here is our first-pass guess
at the cognitive status associated with various types of <b>overt</b>
expressions (for dropped arguments, see below):

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Marker</th><th>COG-ST value</th><th>SPECI value</th></tr>
<tr><td>Personal pronoun</td><td>activ-or-more</td><td>+</td></tr>
<tr><td>Demonstrative article/adjective</td><td>activ+fam</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Definite article/inflection</td><td>uniq+fam+act</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>Indefinite article/inflection</td><td>type-id</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>If you have any overt personal pronouns, constrain their INDEX values
to be <tt>[COG-ST activ-or-more, SPECI + ]</tt>.  

<p>If you have any determiners which mark definitness, have them
constrain the <tt>COG-ST</tt> of their <tt>SPEC</tt> appropriately.
For demonstrative determiners, see below.

<p>If you have any nominal inflections associated with discourse
status, implement lexical rules which add them and constrain the
<tt>COG-ST</tt> value appropriately.

<p>Note that in some cases an unmarked form is underspecified,
where in others it stands in contrast to a marked form.  You should
figure out which is the case for any unmarked forms in your language
(e.g., bare NPs in a language with determiners, unmarked nouns
in a language with definiteness markers), and constrain the unmarked
forms appropriately.  For bare NPs, the place to do this is the bare
NP rule (note that you might have to create separate bare NP rules
for pronouns v. common nouns in this case).  For definiteness affixes,
you'll want a constant-lex-rule that constrains <tt>COG-ST</tt>, and
that is parallel to the inflecting-lex-rule that adds the affix for
the overtly marked case.

<p>Some languages have agreement for definiteness on adjectives.
In this case, you'll want to add lexical rules for adjectives that
constrain the <tt>COG-ST</tt> of the item on their <tt>MOD</tt> list.

<h3>Demonstratives</h3>

<p>All demonstratives (determiners, adjectives and pronouns [not
on the todo list this year]) will share a set of relations
which express the proximity to hearer and speaker.  We will arrange
these relations into a hierarchy so that languages with just a one- or
two-way distinction can be more easily mapped to languages with a two-
or three-way distinction.  In order to do this, we're using
<b>types</b> for these PRED values rather than strings.  Note the
absence of quotation marks.  We will treat the demonstrative relations
as adjectival relations, no matter how they are introduced (via
pronouns, determiners, or quantifiers).


<p>There are (at least) two different types of three-way distinctions.
Here are two of them.  Let me know if your language isn't modeled by either.

<pre>
demonstrative_a_rel := predsort.
proximal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel. ; close to speaker
distal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel.   ; away from speaker
remote+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.      ; away from speaker and hearer
hearer+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.      ; near hearer
</pre>

<pre>
demonstrative_a_rel := predsort.
proximal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel. ; close to speaker
distal+dem_a_rel := demonstrative_a_rel.   ; away from speaker
mid+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.         ; away, but not very far away
far+dem_a_rel := distal+dem_a_rel.         ; very far away
</pre>

<h3>Demonstrative adjectives</h3>

<p>Demonstrative adjectives come out as the easy case in this system.
They are just like regular adjectives, except that in addition to 
introducing a relation whose <tt>PRED</tt> value is one of the subtypes of
<i>demonstrative_a_rel</i> defined above, they also constrain the <tt>INDEX.COG-ST</tt> of their <tt>MOD</tt> value to be <i>activ+fam</i>.

<h3>Demonstrative determiners</h3>

<p>Demonstrative determiners introduce
two relations.  This time, they are introducing the quantifier relation
(Let's say <tt>"exist_q_rel"</tt>) and the demonstrative relation.  
This analysis entails changes to the Matrix core, as 
<i>basic-determiner-lex</i> assumes just one relation being contributed.
Accordingly, we are going to by-pass the current version of <i>basic-determiner-lex</i> and define instead <i>determiner-lex-supertype</i> as follows:

<pre>
determiner-lex-supertype := norm-hook-lex-item & basic-zero-arg &
  [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD det,
			   VAL[ SPEC.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #ind,
				  			     LTOP #larg ],
                                SPR < >,
                                SUBJ < >,
                                COMPS < >]],
		     CONT.HCONS < ! qeq &
				 [ HARG #harg,
				   LARG #larg ] ! > ], 
	     LKEYS.KEYREL quant-relation &
		   [ ARG0 #ind,
		     RSTR #harg ] ] ].
</pre>

<p>This type should have two subtypes (assuming you have demonstrative
determiners as well as others in your language --- otherwise, just incorporate
the constraints for demonstrative determiners into the type above).  

<ol>
<li>The subtype for ordinary (non-demonstrative) determiners should add
the constraint that the RELS list has exactly one thing on it, by
adding the supertype <i>single-rel-lex-item</i>.

<li>The subtype for demonstrative determiners should specify a RELS
list with two things on it: the first should have the
<i>"exist_q_rel"</i> for its <tt>PRED</tt> value. (It's already
constrained to be a <i>quant-relation</i> because the type
<i>norm-hook-lex-item</i> inherited by <i>determiner-lex-supertype</i>
identifies the first element of the <tt>RELS</tt> list with the
<tt>LKEYS.KEYREL</tt>.)  The second one should be identified with
<tt>LKEYS.ALTKEYREL</tt> and should be an <i>arg1-ev-relation</i> (the
type we use for the relations of intransitive adjectives).
The <tt>HOOK.INDEX.COG-ST</tt> inside the <tt>SPEC</tt> value should
be constrained to <tt>activ+fam</tt>.  Finally, the <tt>LBL</tt> and <tt>ARG1</tt> of
the <i>arg1-ev-relation</i> should be identified with the
<tt>SPEC..HOOK.LTOP</tt> and <tt>SPEC..HOOK.INDEX</tt> of the determiner, respectively.  (This will result in the
demonstrative adjective relation sharing its handle with the N' the
determiner attaches to.)
</ol>

<p>Make sure your ordinary determiners in the lexicon inherit
from the first subtype, and that your demonstrative determiners inherit
from the second subtype.  Demonstrative determiner lexical entries
should constrain their <tt>LKEYS.ALTKEYREL.PRED</tt> to be an appropriate
subtype of <i>demonstrative_a_rel</i>.

<hr>

<h2><a name="pro-d">Optional arguments</a></h2>

<p>The customization system now includes an argument optionality
library which we believe to be fairly thorough, regarding the syntax
of optional arguments.  The goal of this part of this lab (this year!)
therefore is to (a) fix up anything that is not quite right in the
syntax and (b) try to model the semantics, and in particular, the
cognitive status associated with different kinds of dropped
arguments. Regarding (a), if the analysis provided by the
customization system isn't quite working, email me and we'll discuss
how to fix it with tdl editing.

<p>Regarding (b), you need to do the following:

<ul>
  <li>Determine the cognitive status of the different types of
  dropped arguments in your language.  For example, dropped subjects
  might always be the equivalent of unstressed pronouns, i.e.,
  <tt>[COG-ST in-foc]</tt>, while objects might be
  <tt>[COG-ST activ-or-more]</tt> (like the dropped argument of
  <i>told</i> in <i>I already told you!</i>) and others might be
  <tt>[COG-ST type-id]</tt> (like the dropped argument of <i>eat</i>
  in <i>Did you already eat?</i>).  Languages with object markers
  might forgo the object markers in the case of <tt>[COG-ST
  type-id]</tt> arguments.  In addition, the <tt>COG-ST</tt> of the
  dropped argument might depend on the verb.
  <li>Edit the lexical rules and lexical entries involved in licensing
  dropped arguments to provide the <tt>COG-ST</tt> value. Since the same argument might be overtly realized in most cases, rather than constraining the <tt>COG-ST</tt> directly, use the feature <tt>OPT-CS</tt> instead.  This feature takes the same range of values as <tt>COG-ST</tt>, and the phrase structure rules that discharge the optional arguments check it for the value of put in <tt>COG-ST</tt>.
  <li>Test examples and examine the MRS to see if the expected <tt>COG-ST</tt> values are appearing.
</ul>

<p>Note that the Matrix currently assumings that dropped subjects are always
<tt>[COG-ST in-foc]</tt>.  This may not be true, especially in various
impersonal constructions.  If it's not true for your language, please let
me know.

<hr>
<a name="corpus"><h2>Test corpus</h2></a>

<p>In order to get a sense of the coverage of our grammars over
naturally occurring text, we are going to collect small test corpora.
Minimally, these should consist of 10-20 sentences from running
text. They could be larger, however, that is not recommended unless:

<ul>
<li>Your language has a simple enough morphophonology that your
grammar is directly targeting surface forms.
<li>You have easy access to large digitized texts (i.e., you don't have
to type something in by hand).
<li>1,000 sentences is the maximum practical size for any single
[incr tsdb()] skeleton.  You could of course split your test corpus
over multiple skeletons, but I'd be surprised if anyone got close
to 1,000 sentences!
</ul>

<p>Note also that our grammars won't cover anything without lexicon.
If you have access to a digitized lexical resource that you can import
lexical items from, you can address this to a certain extent.  Otherwise,
you'll want to limit your test corpus to a size that you are willing
to hand-enter vocabulary for.  (If you have access to a Toolbox lexicon
for your language, contact me about importing via the customization
system.)

<p>For Lab 5, your task is to locate your test corpus (10-20 sentences
will be sufficient, more if you want) and format it for [incr tsdb()].
If you have IGT to work with in the first place, it may be convenient
to use the make_item.pl script to create the test corpus skeleton.  (Note
that you want this to be separate from your regular test suite skeleton.)
Otherwise, you can use [incr tsdb()]'s own import tool (File | Import | Test items) which expects a plain text file with one item per line.  The result
of that command is a testsuite profile from which you'll need to copy
the item (and relations) file to create a testsuite skeleton.

<p>Check list:

<ul>
<li>tsdb/skeletons directory should include two subdirectories: one for the test corpus, and one for the test suite.
<li>tsdb/skeletons/Index.lisp should include two lines: one for your test corpus and one for your test suite.
<li>When the Skeletons Root is pointed at your tsdb/skeletons directory, File | Create should show two possibilities (test suite and test corpus).
<li>The items in your test corpus should be in the format (standard orthography or transliteration, morpheme segmented or not) that your grammar expects.
</ul>

<hr>
<a name="write"><h2>Write up your analyses</h2></a>

<p>For each of the following phenomena, please include
the following your write up:

<ol>
  <li>A descriptive statement of the facts of your language.
  <li>Illustrative IGT examples from your testsuite.
  <li>A statement of how you implemented the phenomenon, in terms of types you added/modified and particular tdl constraints.  That is, I want to see actual tdl snippets with prose descriptions around them.
  <li>If the analysis is not (fully) working, a description of the problems
  you are encountering.
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Adjectival and adverbial modifiers.
  <li>Agreement between adjectives and head nouns.  (If your language doesn't have this, then just say so.)
  <li>Demonstratives and markers of definiteness.
  <li>Argument optionality.
  <li>Anything else you fixed.
</ul>

<p>In addition, your write up should include a statement of the current
coverage of your grammar over your test suite (using numbers you can
get from Analyze | Coverage and Analyze | Overgeneration in [incr tsdb()])
and a comparison between your baseline test suite run and your final
one for this lab (see Compare | Competence).

<P>Finally please briefly describe your test corpus, including: where
you collected it, how many sentences it contains, and what format
(transliterated, etc) it is in.
