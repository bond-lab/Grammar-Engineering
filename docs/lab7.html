<h2><a name="baseline">Run a baseline test suite</a></h2>

<p>Before making any changes to your grammar for this lab,
run a baseline test suite instance.  If you decide to add 
items to your test suite for the material covered here, consider
doing so before modifying your grammar so that your baseline can
include those examples.  (Alternatively, if you add examples
in the course of working on your grammar and want to make the
snapshot later, you can do so using the grammar you turned
in for Lab 6.)

<hr>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The goal of this lab is to be able to parse the two
sentences <i>I can eat glass.  It doesn't hurt me.</i>,
assign them appropriate semantics, and generate back.  You have already
done some of the work: from previous labs, your grammar
should already handle pronouns, case (if applicable), and
transitive verbs.  Negation may already be working from
the customization system and/or previous work you've done.
You may need to add some vocabulary
and possibly some verb forms.
In addition, depending on how the sentences translate
in your language, you might need to consider a new valence pattern
for verbs and a new type of nouns (mass nouns).


<a name="mrs"><h3>Semantic representations</h3></a>

<p>Your semantic representations for the two sentences should look
approximately like this, modulo the relations showing up in a different
order, the variables (e's, x's, and h's) showing up with different
numbers, the SEMSORT information showing up in different places.
Also, if your language tends to use prodrop rather than overt pronouns,
you might end up without any representation of the pronouns in these sentences.
Finally, if you need a complex predicate in place of, say, "hurt",
then you'll also have some differences.
<ul>
<a name="glass"><li>I can eat glass.</a>

<pre>
&lt;h1,e2:SEMSORT,
{h3:pronoun_n_rel(x4:SEMSORT:+:FIRST:SG),
h5:exist_q_rel(x4, h7, h6),
h1:_can_v_rel(e2:SEMSORT:TENSE:ASPECT:MOOD, h8),
h9:_eat_v_rel(e10:SEMSORT:TENSE:ASPECT:MOOD, x4, x11:SEMSORT:BOOL:THIRD:SG)
h12:_glass_n_rel(x11),
h13:exist_q_rel(x11,h15,h14)}
{h8 qeq h9,
h6 qeq h3,
h14 qeq h12} >
</pre>

<p>Things to note about this representation: <i>_can_v_rel</i>
is a one-place relation (i.e., we're treating <i>can</i> as a raising
    verb), whose ARG1 is qeq (equal modulo quantifiers) to the handle
of the <i>_eat_v_rel</i> as its argument.  The <i>_eat_v_rel</i> is a
two-place relation taking <b>x4</b> (the index from the first-person
pronoun) and <b>x12</b> (the ARG0 of <i>_glass_n_rel</i>) as its
arguments.

<a name="hurt"><li>It doesn't hurt me.</a>

<pre>
&lt;h1,e2:SEMSORT,
{h3:pronoun_n_rel(x4:SEMSORT:+:THIRD:SG),
h5:exist_q_rel(x4, h7, h6),
h1:_neg_r_rel(u9:SEMSORT, h8),
h10:_hurt_v_rel(e2:SEMSORT:TENSE:ASPECT:MOOD, x4, x11:SEMSORT:+:FIRST:SG),
h12:pronoun_n_rel(x11),
h13:exist_q_rel(x11, h15, h14)},
{h6 qeq h3,
h8 qeq h10,
h14 qeq h12} >
</pre>

<p>Things to note about this representation: The <i>_neg_r_rel</i>
takes a handle as its argument, which is related through a <i>qeq</i>
to the handle of the <i>_hurt_v_rel</i>.  The handle of
<i>_neg_r_rel</i> is itself in turn the local top handle of the
clause.  These <i>qeq</i>s allow quantifiers to scope above or below
<i>_neg_r_rel</i> so that <i>I can't eat some cheese</i> can either
mean 'There is some cheese that I can't eat', or 'I can't eat just
some cheese (I end up eating more)'.  

</ul>
<hr>

<a name="can"><h2>Modals</h2></a>

<h3><i>can</i> as an auxiliary verb</h3>

<p>Use this version if in your language the morpheme expressing
the same notion as <i>can</i> is a separate word which takes a
VP complement and a subject.

<ul>
<li>Define a new verb type which inherits from your <i>verb-lex</i>
    and <i>trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-1</i> (and take a look at
the definition of this type in <tt>matrix.tdl</tt> so you
know what they're doing).  If you already have auxiliaries from
  the customization system, see if you have a type like this already.
  (Note that this is the type for semantically contentful/elementary predication contributing auxiliaries.  If the rest of you auxiliaries are of the semantically empty type, you'll need to create a new type.)

<ul>
<li>In addition to inheriting
from these types, your new type should put appropriate constraints
on the values of ARG-ST and the valence features.
  <li>If your auxiliary can be the input to any of your lexical rules, make sure that it has the right supertypes (xxx-rule-dtr) to serve as the input to right rules.
<li>Make sure that it constrains the part of speech of each
argument.
</ul>

<li>Define a lexical entry (with PRED value <tt>"_can_v_rel"</tt>
which inherits from your new type.

<li>Create the appropriate form of the verb meaning <i>eat</i>, if necessary.
This can be done either directly as a lexical entry, or via a lexical rule.

<li>If you needed an additional form of <i>eat</i>, ensure that only that form of <i>eat</i> can appear as the
complement of <i>can</i> (and add whatever items you use to test
this to your master testsuite), and that the new form of <i>eat</i>
can or can't appear in matrix clauses (as appropriate).

<ul>
<li>In English, this involves defining a feature <tt>FORM</tt> on 
<i>verb</i> (subtype of <i>head</i>), somewhat similar to 
CASE on <i>noun</i>.  You may have a <tt>FORM</tt> feature and some
  appropriate types already from the customization system.
</ul>

<li>Parse your translation of <i>I can eat glass</i>, and examine
the chart for extra edges.  Are they legitimate, or spurious?
If they're spurious, try to rule them out (and then rerun your
master testsuite to see if they were, in fact, spurious :-).

<li>Parse your translation of  <i>I can eat glass</i> and
see if you get the <a href="#glass">right semantics</a>. Debug
as necessary.
</ul>

<h3><i>can</i> as a bound morpheme</h3>

<p>Use this version if the morpheme expressing the same meaning as
<i>can</i> in your language attaches morphologically to the main verb
of the sentence.

<ul>
<a name="potential"><li>The first step is to decide which
    lexical rule type is appropriate.  Look at the section
    of <tt>matrix.tdl</tt> titled "Lexical Rules" and see if
    any of the xxx-only-xxx-rule types are appropriate.
    If not, construct an appropriate one out of the next level
    of supertypes.  Unless you have concomittant changes
    to the valence features (such as the <tt>CASE</tt> value required
    on one of the arguments), something like the following is probably
  appropriate:

    <pre>
    infl-add-ccont-ltow-rule := same-non-local-lex-rule &
                                same-cat-lex-rule &
                                same-ctxt-lex-rule &
                                same-agr-lex-rule &
                                inflecting-lex-rule &
                                nocoord.
    </pre>


  <li>You'll also need to add lexeme-to-lexeme-rule or lexeme-to-word-rule, depending on how this rule fits into your morphology.

    <li>Your subtype for this particular rule will now need to
constrain all three features within its <tt>C-CONT</tt>: <tt>RELS,
HCONS</tt> and <tt>HOOK</tt>.  (The <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.XARG</tt> can be
identified with the <tt>HOOK.XARG</tt> of the daughter.):

<ul>
<li>The lexical rule's <tt>C-CONT.RELS</tt> is a diff list containing a single relation
of type <i>arg1-ev-relation</i>.  The <tt>PRED</tt> value of that relation
should be <tt>"_can_v_rel"</tt>, the <tt>LBL</tt> should be identified
with the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.LTOP</tt>, the <tt>ARG0</tt> with the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.INDEX</tt>.
<li>The lexical rule's <tt>C-CONT.HCONS</tt> is a diff list containing
one <i>qeq</i>.  The <tt>HARG</tt> of the <i>qeq</i> should be identified
with the <tt>ARG1</tt> of the <i>arg1-ev-relation</i> and its <tt>LARG</tt>
with the daugther's <tt>LTOP</tt>.
</ul>

<li>In order to get the affix in the right place in a chain
of affixes, constrain the DTR value so that the possible inputs
to the rule are the class of affixes that can occur just inside
this one.  If further affixes attach afterwards, add the appropriate
xxx-rule-dtr supertype to the rule type.

<li>Add an instance for your lexical rule to <tt>irules.tdl</tt>,
with the appropriate spelling change information.

<li>If appropriate, make sure that your rule applies only to verbs, and
test this. 

<li>Parse your translation of  <i>I can eat glass</i> and
see if you get the <a href="#glass">right semantics</a>. Debug
as necessary.
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="neg"><h2>Negation</h2></a>

<h3>Two-part negation</h3>

<p>Use this version if your language expresses negation with
both an affix on the verb and an adverb (e.g., French <i>ne ... pas</i>).
If both elements are arguably affixes, you probably just want
to write a pair of lexical rules, i.e., take the "Negation as a
verbal affix" route, but write two rules and make sure you
can require that they both apply or neither apply.

<ul>
<li>The strategy here is going to be add the affix with a lexical rule
similar to the one above, but to have it change the COMPS value and
not add any semantics. The COMPS list will be the same as the input's
COMPS list, with the addition of a negative adverb.  

<li>We're assuming that the second part of the negation has
an independent life as a negative adverb for constituent (i.e.,
not sentential) negation.  This seems to work for French at first
glance, I'd be curious about other languages.  That adverb will
have to have constraints on its MOD value that keep it from 
modifying finite verbs (which would give sentential negation).
However, if you don't have any head-modifier rules in your grammar,
you don't need to worry about that yet.

<li>The negative adverb needs some kind of distinguished value (a
feature inside <tt>HEAD</tt>, and in particular,
<tt>HEAD.KEYS.KEY</tt> might be a good candidate) so that the rule
won't license verbs just picking up any adverb as a complement.

<li>The inflected verb will "hand" its <tt>LTOP</tt> value to the negative
particle, and adopt the negative particle's <tt>LTOP</tt> value as its
own.  Regular semantic composition should take care of the rest.

<li>Again, you'll need to look at the lexrule types and pick an
    appropriate supertype.  Since we're changing both <tt>VAL.COMPS</tt>
    and <tt>CONT.HOOK</tt>, you might need to create your own supertype.
    Talk to me :).

<li>Test your grammar: Try parsing your translation
of <i>It doesn't hurt me.</i> and see if you're getting
the <a href="#hurt">right semantics</a>.  Test sentences
with each of the two parts of the negation independently,
and verify that they don't parse.  Try putting the two
part negation on a non-verb, and verify that it doesn't
parse.  
Debug as necessary.

</ul>


<h3>Negation: markers on either end</h3>

<p>This option is for languages that mark negation with particles on
either end of the clause or VP (or alternatively, with intonation or
[in signed languages] non-manual signs which extend the length of the
clause/constituent and are represented in transcription with markers
on either end).  

<p>If the two markers show up immediately adjacent to the verb
(rather than VP or S), consider whether it might be more appropriate
to treat them as inflection.

<p>The first thing is to consider whether there is any evidence for
attaching the markers one at a time.  In these instructions I focus on
the case where there is not, so please contact me if you think the
markers should attach one at a time in your language.  Rather than
attach one of these markers before the other, the most
straight-forward thing appears to be to create a ternary rule.  I've
added some types supporting ternary rules to the matrix (included in
the patch provided last week).

<p>We're going to take a construction-y approach to analysis, creating
a phrase structure rule which calls for specific elements in two
of the three daughters and does the right thing in the semantics itself.
Specifically, do the following:

<ul>
<li>Create a lexical type which encodes the constraints in common to
the left and right markers. If the same elements have some other
function in the grammar, write the constraints accordingly.  If they
don't, make the lexical type a subtype of <i>norm-zero-arg</i> and
make sure its valence lists, <tt>MOD</tt> value, <tt>RELS</tt> and
<tt>HCONS</tt> lists are all empty.  You should also give it a distinctive
<tt>HEAD</tt> value (lest it show up as the argument of something else).
For example, in the ASL case, there should probably be a new subtype
of head for non-manual markers:

<pre>
nmm := head.
</pre>

<li>Create subtypes of your lexical type for the left-hand and
right-hand elements.  These subtypes don't need additional constraints,
just contrasting names.

<li>Create lexical entries of each of the subtypes, with the
appropriate <tt>STEM</tt> value.  These elements don't need any
<tt>KEYREL</tt> information.

<li>Create a type <i>negation-phrase</i> which inherits from
<i>ternary-head-middle-phrase</i>.  This
supertype will make sure that the 
<tt>HEAD</tt> and <tt>VAL</tt> values come from the
head daughter (the middle daughter).  

<li>You may need to specify the
value of other features inside <tt>CAT</tt> on the mother, either 
copying them from the head daughter or otherwise specifying them appropriately.
If you do need to, you'll be able to tell because your grammar will be
over-generating.

<li>To get the construction to contribute the right semantics, you'll
need to constrain its <tt>C-CONT</tt> value.  In particular:

<ul>
<li>The <tt>C-CONT.RELS</tt> is a diff list containing a single relation
of type <i>arg1-ev-relation</i>.  The <tt>PRED</tt> value of that relation
should be <tt>"_neg_r_rel"</tt>, the <tt>LBL</tt> should be identified
with the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.LTOP</tt>, the <tt>ARG0</tt> with the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.INDEX</tt>.
<li><tt>C-CONT.HCONS</tt> is a diff list containing
one <i>qeq</i>.  The <tt>HARG</tt> of the <i>qeq</i> should be identified
with the <tt>ARG1</tt> of the <i>arg1-ev-relation</i> and its <tt>LARG</tt>
with the head daugther's <tt>LTOP</tt>.
<li>The <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.XARG</tt> should be identified with the head
daughter's <tt>HOOK.XARG</tt>.
</ul>

<li>Constrain the first and third elements of the ARGS list of
<i>negation-phrase</i> to be the lexical types of your left and
right markers, respectively.

<li>Create an instance of <i>negation-phrase</i> in
<tt>rules.tdl</tt> and test it!  Make sure you get the <a href="#hurt">the right
semantics</a>
</ul>


<h3>Negation as an adverb modifier</h3>

<P><font color="purple">If your language uses an adverbial strategy,
the customization script probably did the right thing.  This is included
just in case.</font>

<p>Use this version if your language expresses sentential negation
via an adverb which modifies the V, VP or S. 

<p><font size=2>(Note:
English has two forms of sentential negation "contracted", which
is actually an affix on the verb, cf. Zwicky and Pullum 1983,
and the full-form adverb.  This adverb is not actually treated
syntactically as a modifier in sentential negation, but rather
selected by auxiliary verbs, including the <i>do</i> of do-support.
For the details of this analysis, see Sag, Wasow and Bender 2003
chapter 13 and Kim and Sag 1995.  I would be surprised if another
language being treated in this class had a system very similar to
the English one, as it seems like a pretty quirky part of English
grammar.  Further, it's a subtle matter to establish what is actually
going on in English, and I don't think anyone would have time in
one week to show the same about another language.)</font>

<ul>
<li>Determine where your negative adverb attaches: to V, VP or
S and whether it attaches to the left or to the right of the node
it attaches to.
<li>For testing purposes, develop a set of sentences contrasting
the correct attachment with the incorrect attachments.
<li>Negative adverbs are scopal modifiers, so even though we did 
adverbs in the previous lab, you'll need to add some machinery:

<ul>
<li>Define an instance of <i>adj-head-scop-phrase</i> and/or
<i>head-adj-scop-phrase</i> in <tt>rules.tdl</tt>.  (These types
are fairly fully specified, which means you'll most likely not need to
put anything in <tt>esperanto.tdl</tt>.) Which one
you pick depends on whether your negative adverb is prehead
or posthead (or either).  Look at the type definitions in <tt>matrix.tdl</tt>
to decide which is appropriate. 

<li>Create a subtype of <i>basic-scopal-adverb-lex</i>.  That type
    (through its supertypes) does much of the work for you. You will
    need to constrain is <tt>VAL</tt> and <tt>MOD..CAT</tt> values.  The
    matrix type also leaves <tt>ARG-ST</tt> underconstrained.  For
    consistency, if your adverb takes no arguments (and I'd be a bit
    surprised if the negative element did), <tt>ARG-ST</tt> should be
    constrained to be empty as well.

<li>Create a lexical entry which inherits from <i>scopal-adverb-lex</i>
and introduces a relation with the PRED value <tt>'neg_r_rel</tt>.
</ul>

<li>Test your grammar.  Does the adverb show up only where it's
supposed to?  Do you get the <a href="#hurt">right semantics</a> for
<i>It doesn't hurt me.</i>?  Debug as necessary.  </ul>


<h3>Negation as a verbal affix</h3>

<P><font color="purple">If your language uses an adverbial strategy,
the customization script probably did the right thing.  This is included
just in case.</font>

<p>Use this version if your language expresses sentential negation
by adding a morpheme to the main verb.

<ul>
<li>The lexical rule for a negative verb will add a semantic
relation in much the same way as the potential form (for
<i>can</i> as verbal inflection) described <a href="#potential">above</a>,
so follow the directions there about selecting a supertype for
    the rule.

<li>This time, the C-CONT RELS and HCONS lists, will each have
one item on them:

<pre>
RELS < ! adv-relation &
         [ PRED '_neg_r_rel,
           ARG1 #harg ] ! >

HCONS < ! qeq &
         [ HARG #harg,
	   LARG #larg ] !>
</pre>

<li>In addition, the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.LTOP</tt> should be identified with
the <tt>LBL</tt> of the <i>adv-relation</i> and the <tt>C-CONT.HOOK.INDEX</tt> with
    the <tt>ARG0</tt>.

<li>Add an instance for your lexical rule to <tt>irules.tdl</tt>,
with the appropriate spelling change information.

<li>Constrain your lexical rule to apply only to verbs, and
test this. 

<li>If you have other verbal inflection in your language, determine
which lexical rule has to go first, and constrain the rules to only
apply in that order.  Make up nonsense forms with the affixes attached
the other way around, and make sure that they don't parse.  If your
other affixes attach to the other end of the verb, you'll want to
constrain the order anyway, or you will end up getting double parses.
    
<li>Parse your translation of  <i>It doesn't hurt me</i> and
see if you get the <a href="#hurt">right semantics</a>.
Debug as necessary.
</ul>
