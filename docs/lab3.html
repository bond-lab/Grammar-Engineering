<h1>Lab 3</h1>


<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p>The goal of this lab is to continue development of your test suite
on the one hand, and to refine your starter grammar on the other.  We
will be extending both to cover additional phenomena, but you may wish
to revisit some of the sentences/choices from Lab 2.  Again, you'll
want to work on these two subtasks in parallel, though they are
described separately in the instructions below.

<p><a href="lab3.html">Back to top</a>

  
  
<h2>Test Suite</h2>

<p>The first task is to create positive and negative example sentences
illustrating the following phenomena, to the extent that they
are relevant for your language:

<ul>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#tma">tense/aspect</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#agreement">agreement</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#neg">negation</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#opt">argument optionality</a>
  <li><a href="testsuites.html#demo">demonstratives/definiteness</a>
</ul>

<p>Before you start, read the <a
href="testsuites.html#preliminaries">general instructions for
testsuites</a> and the <a href="testsuites.html#formatting">formatting
instructions.</a>

<p><a href="lab3.html">Back to top</a>


<h2>Starter grammar</h2>

<p>The second task is to update your starter grammar by filling out
the required sections of the <a href="http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/customize/matrix.cgi">Grammar Matrix customization questionnaire</a>.  The goal
here is to get as much coverage as you can over your test suite using
only the customization system (no hand-editing of tdl files yet).  In
particular, you'll need to address these sections:

<ul>
  <li>Tense and aspect
  <li>Word order (if you need to add auxiliaries)
  <li>Argument optionality
  <li>Sentential negation
  <li>Lexicon: 
<ul>
  <li>Rules for agreement affixes
  <li>Rules for tense/aspect markers
  <li>Rules for any other affixes that are required so you get fully inflected forms
  <li>Addition of auxiliaries if necessary
</ul>
</ul>

<p>Begin by uploading your choices file from lab 2, and modify from
there.  Ask lots of questions!

<p>NB: The sentential negation section is under development and
might have more than their usual share of bugs.  So start early so we have
a chance to work that out.

<p>I will try to get feedback on lab2 to you quickly.  Please read
that feedback for any other suggestions on how to improve your choices file.

<h2>Make sure you can parse individual sentences</h2>

<p>Once you have created  your starter grammar (or each time you
create one, as you should iterate through grammar creation and
testing a few times as you refine your choices), try it out on a
couple of sentences interactively to see if it works:

<ol>
  <Li>Load the grammar into the LKB.
  <li>Using the parse dialog box (or 'C-c p' in emacs  to get the parse
  command inserted at your prompt), enter a sentence to parse.
  <li>Examine the results.  If it does parse, check out the semantics (pop-up menu on the little trees).  If it doesn't look at the parse chart to see why not.
  <li>Problems with lexical rules and lexical entries often become apparent here, too: If the LKB can't find an analysis for one of your words, it will say so, and (obviously) fail to parse the sentence.
</ol>

<p>Note that the questionnaire has a section for test sentences.  If
you use this, then the parse dialog will be pre-filled with your test sentences.

<h2>[incr tsdb()] profile</h2>

<p>The final step for this lab is to use the [incr tsdb()] grammar
profiling system to test the performance of your starter grammar over
your test suite, and then examine the results.  (You may find in doing
so that you want to refine certain aspects of your starter grammar.
You can do this by uploading the file "choices" which comes with your
grammar into the customization system and then tweaking from there.)

<h3>Create a test suite skeleton</h3>

<ul>
<li>From last week, you sould already have a <tt>tsdb</tt> directory
with subdirectories <tt>skeletons</tt> and <tt>home</tt>.  
<li>The <tt>skeletons</tt> subdirectory should have files <tt>Relations</tt>
and <tt>Index.lisp</tt>.
<li>Use <a href="make_item.pl"><tt>make_item.pl</tt></a> to create
a new <tt>item</tt> file from your current testsuite.
<li>You can replace <tt>skeletons/lab2/item</tt> with this new file,
or create a new subdirectory in <tt>skeletons</tt> called <tt>lab3</tt>.
In that case, you'll need to copy <tt>skeletons/Relations</tt> to
<tt>skeletons/lab3/relations</tt>, put your new <tt>item</tt> in
<tt>skeletons/lab3/</tt>, and edit <tt>Index.lisp</tt> to add a line
for the <tt>lab3</tt> skeleton.
</ul>

<h3>Create and run an initial test suite instance</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start the lkb
<li>Load your starter grammar.  (The script file is in matrix/lkb/script.)
<li>Start [incr tsdb()] (within emacs, that's M-x itsdb)
<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select Options > Database Root
and input the path to <tt>tsdb/home</tt>.
<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select Options > Skeleton Root
and input the path to <tt>tsdb/skeletons</tt>.
<li>Optional: For future use, you can set these variables
ahead of time in a file called <tt>.tsdbrc</tt> in your home directory.
It should contain these lines, with path names edited appropriately:

<pre>
(in-package :tsdb)
(setf *tsdb-home* "path-to-tsdb/home")
(setf *tsdb-skeleton-directory* "path-to-tsdb/skeletons")
</pre>

<li>In the [incr tsdb()] podium, select File > Create.  You should
see your test suite in the menu there.  Select it, and get a test suite
instance. Post to GoPost if this doesn't work.
<li>Make sure your grammr is loaded into the LKB.
<li>Once you have a test suite instance, select it (by clicking on it),
then do Process > All Items.
<li>Explore the results, with functions such as Browse > Results and Analyze > Competence.
<li>Be sure to save (i.e., not overwrite or delete) this test suite
instance, as you'll be asked to turn it in.
</ol>

<p><a href="lab3.html">Back to top</a>

<h2>Write up</h2>

<p>Your write up should include the following:

<ol>
  <li>Documentation the new or revised choices you made in the customization
  system, illustrated with examples from your test suite.  (Diff your lab2 and lab3 choices files to make sure you've caught all the changes.) Here's <a href="write-up-sample.html">an example</a> of what this should look like.
  <li>Descriptions of any properties of your language illustrated
  in your test suite but not covered by your starter grammar and/or
  the customization system.
  <li>Documentation the coverage of your grammar over the testsuite.
  If there are examples that thare parsed incorrectly (unanalyzed
  grammatical examples, analyzed ungrammatical examples, or grammatical
  examples assigned surprising parses), reflect on why that might be.
  <li>Finally, if there are any places where the customization system
  seems unable to cope with the properties of your language (within the
  phenomena addressed in this lab), describe them here.
</ol>

<h2><a name="submit">Submit your assignment</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure your write up and the text-file version of your test suite are
  included in your grammar directory.
  <li>Likewise, make sure to include your most current tsdb profile in the grammar directory (ideally inside tsdb/home/).
  <li>Create a tarball:

  <pre>
      tar czf yourname.tgz yourgrammar
    </pre>

  <li>Email the tarball to <a href="mailto:bond@ieee.org?subject=[HG7021] lab3">bond@ieee.org</a>.
